# NibblesProject
The Problem Nibbles is a snake. Nibbles moves around a field, looking for food. Unfortunately, Nibbles is not a very clever snake. It will try to eat anything it can reach. When it eats food, it grows. When it eats the electric fence around its field, it dies. When it gets all twisted up, it can even try to eat itself, which also causes it to die. The player of the game will control the movement of the snake. The objective, of course, it to eat as much food (and grow) as much as possible, without dying.
